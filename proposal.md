# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

- Evolving to Survive

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project/game will be based on a storyline adventure with comedic and serious scenarios to surpass your survival on a stranded island.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

- As stated in the previous question, our project/game will be based on a storyline adventure with comedic and serious scenarios to surpass your survival on a stranded island. The island will be the blank canvas that we see when we run the program. The character, which is you, the user, will walk through a path of challenges to escape the stranded island. If you fail a challenge, you will be stranded on the island FOREVER. "DUN DUN DUN" Just kidding. The program will return the user to the beginning to repeat the mission.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- A flowing plot with no plotholes
- "Choose your path" storyline questions
- Creating well-defined challenges/quests
- Continuous challenges to keep users hooked

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Art & Graphics for the game
- A complete story with an ending for every user choice

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Good flow
- Complete graphics, including the character and the background design of the game.
- Maybe background music or sounds (if possible)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Since we are all new to coding, we want to explore the depths of Python in gaming (PyGame). We will be reviewing games that have been created via Python and learning from them. Then, we plan on creating the factors needed to create a storyline game. This consist of characters, settings, challenges, and etc. Once we have the factors figured out, we plan on reviewing lessons/skills we have learned throughout this semester and see what can be used in our game. In addition to Python, we will be researching how to create the game using arts/graphics to bring the game to life.
